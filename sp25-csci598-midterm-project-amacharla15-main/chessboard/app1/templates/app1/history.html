  <h5>History</h5>
  <p>
    Chess is a two-player strategy board game where opponents take turns moving their pieces with the objective of checkmating the opponentâ€™s king.
    It is an abstract game that relies entirely on skill, as there is no element of chance or hidden information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How to Play</strong><br>
    Each player starts with 16 pieces, which include a king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns.
    The player controlling the white pieces always moves first.
    Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn to a different square on the board.
    The ultimate goal is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under attack and has no legal moves to escape.
    A game can also end in a draw due to various circumstances, such as mutual agreement, stalemate, repetition of moves, the fifty-move rule, or resignation.
